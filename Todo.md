# TODOs
With priority:

- Intergrate current 2 version of cpio.
- `make all` is broken due to bootloader share files with kernel.
- `kmalloc()` and `kfree()` that automatically use dynamic allocator or page allocator.
- Better slab allocation.
- Fix all headers, put private members to .c file.
- Universally intergrate basic_type.h.
- Make up for the missing document of each lab.
- Initramfs parsing in `initramfs.c`.
- Compile path without `-g` option.
- Refine parsing in device tree.
